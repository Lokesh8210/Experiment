I Love My Country 
My country, my love, my heart beats for thee, With every breath, my soul sings free, I pledge my allegiance, my loyalty true, For I am a patriot, through and through. From sea to shining sea, from mountains to plains, Our land is a tapestry of colors and strains, A nation of immigrants, united we stand, A beacon of freedom, across every land.
